we use phpMyAdmin and xampp to develop the web, so it's best if you've already downloaded xampp (with Apache and MySQL)

and then go to the folder that you've setup your xmapp > htdocs
delete everything in that folder and replace it with the library folder

open xampp control panel > start Apache > open MySQL config
set the password to your password

open folder function_readme and run the sql files

open the connection.php
change the $db to your server name, username, password, database
then run the sql file, finally go to http://localhost/library/index.php to run index.
